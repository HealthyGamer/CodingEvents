# Creating Your First Coding Project

**tldr;**
Make a todo app in Python (JS if you want to do web)

## Why do we make side projects?

- Get a job
- Improve skills
- Create tool for myself/others
- Code without the constraints of a job (be creative)
- Possibly make money (more for experienced devs)

## What gets in the way?

- Can’t decide what to do
- Can’t code well enough
- Too big/intimidating
- It’s too hard
- Can’t find time
- Too many/too few resources (don’t know how to research)
- Toxic communities

## Things to understand

- I can’t start your project for you- eventually you have to actually do the thing.
- You will never be ready to start your first project, and you won’t really be ready for your first job. Go for it anyway- failure is a normal part of the learning process.
- Learning to code is not too difficult. Learning to code well is hard. We all learn to write but not everyone is a professional author.
- [Why Learning to Code is So Hard](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/)
- Side projects as a professional dev are different from the projects you do when you are first learning (sometimes). aka creating a product you can make money off of generally shouldn’t be in your list of goal IMO
- What project you pick doesn’t actually matter that much. Flip a coin or roll a die if you need to. Build a random coding project generator. ;)
- Software is never “finished” in a lot of ways. You could always improve the code quality a bit, add a feature, or fix a bug. You can create a list of features for your MVP and target that. At that point the project is “done” even if you keep working on it.
- You have a major advantage- community. The tech community can be toxic, especially for newbies.
- You are on your own timeline. “30 projects in 30 days” and stuff like that is cool, but not required.

## Starter Projects

- Todo App
- Calculator App
- Simple Game (tic-tac-toe - [Example](https://jsfiddle.net/oneangrypenguin/tnmr39ew/))
- Budget App
- Custom user interface for a service you use via their API
- Personal/Professional page
- Chat app
- Pomodoro Timer
- Link Shortener
- Clone a website/app/etc you use often

## Process

1. Figure out when you are going to work on your project. 
2. (If you are new and not doing CS degree or bootcamp) 
    - Figure out a language (Python or JS)
    - Doesn’t matter if you need to change later- first one is the hardest
    - Use something like [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) to get the basics
    - You don’t need to complete it, just get an initial idea of what to do aka need to learn the alphabet so you can start reading
3. (Start here if you already know the basics) 
    - Pick a project- roll a die if you have to. The specific project really doesn’t matter that much. (todo app is a good default)
    - Decide on the features you want in your project- you can make a wish list, but for now you only want to work on the minimum number of items you need to create a working project (MVP)
        - Create a Todo, list todos, mark a todo as complete
    - Break your first feature into individual tasks
        - User enters text
        - User click submit
        - Data is sent to API
        - todo is stored in DB
        - the response is sent back to the UI
        - UI is updated with the new todo
    - Build the first task
    - Build the second task
    - (etc., etc.)
    - Refactor only when there are bugs or code is completely unusable while you are creating that feature- don’t worry about “pretty” at this point.
    - At the end of each feature look through your code and you can do small adjustments- again, don’t spend a lot of time trying to get it perfect.
4. Once you’ve completed your MVP you are now “allowed” to spend some time on code cleanup.
5. Congrats! you’ve completed your first project. Show it off if you’d like in #cw | projects
6. Take a bit and reflect on how the project went. At this point you have a choice- continue to add some of those wishlist features to your current project or start a new one.
