# Breaking Projects Into Tasks

When working on a project, it is common to immediately start breaking things down into individual steps. This can work well in small projects, but it can cause you to get lost in the details of more significant tasks. Time is lost on unnecessary tasks, and seeing if all the goals will be met is challenging.

Agile project planning is an approach to managing projects emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability. Unlike traditional project management methods, which often follow a rigid and linear path, agile project planning embraces change and encourages frequent iterations. It involves breaking down a project into smaller, manageable tasks, prioritizing them based on their value and urgency, and working on them in short sprint cycles.

It's important to remember that a critical component of working with an agile framework is that the process is flexible, not just the plan. Applying it to different projects might result in strategies that use the same overall ideas but look very different.

## Project Layers

In business, several layers exist between the overall strategy and day-to-day tasks. While we'll only focus on the bottom three, knowing that the project needs to function within a larger context is helpful.

- Strategy: The strategy layer defines a business's goals, objectives, and vision. It sets the direction and long-term project planning, considering market analysis, competition, and business objectives. This layer provides the high-level framework within which projects are executed.
- Portfolio: The portfolio layer focuses on managing a collection of projects within an organization. It involves prioritizing, selecting, and aligning projects with the company's strategic objectives. The portfolio layer ensures that resources, budgets, and timelines are allocated effectively across various projects to maximize overall organizational success.
- Product: The product layer revolves around developing and delivering a specific product or service. It includes defining the product requirements, identifying the target market, conducting market research, and creating a product roadmap. The product layer ensures that the final output meets customer needs and aligns with the organization's overall strategy.
- Project: The project layer represents the specific initiatives or endeavors to achieve the desired product or outcome. It involves planning, organizing, and executing the project activities, assigning resources, and managing the project timeline and budget. The project layer focuses on delivering the desired results within the defined constraints.
- Iteration (Sprint): The iteration layer refers to the repetitive cycles or sprints within a project's timeline. It involves breaking down the project into smaller, manageable parts and working on them in iterative cycles. Each iteration typically lasts for a fixed duration, resulting in a working deliverable or increment of the final product. The iteration layer allows feedback, learning, and adaptation throughout the project's execution.
- Day: The day layer represents a project's daily activities and tasks. It involves the day-to-day execution, coordination, and collaboration among team members. The day layer focuses on completing specific tasks, addressing challenges, and ensuring progress toward the project's objectives. Daily activities can include meetings, discussions, task assignments, and updates on project status.

## Understand the Project

Every project begins by clearly understanding its purpose, objectives, and desired outcomes. Defining the project's context and importance helps everyone involved align their efforts toward a common goal. Things like project requirements documents help centralize and format this information. Another format that may help structure project planning is [SMART goals](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals), another framework for creating a functional plan.

### Project Scope and Requirements

Setting the project scope clarifies what will be included and excluded from the project. This includes identifying who is involved with the project, the requirements, and any limitations. Creating priorities will also inform what order tasks are completed.

### Project Planning and Organization

Effective project planning involves creating a schedule, milestones, and deadlines, enabling teams to track progress and meet project objectives. It is also essential to understand what resources are available and what project members are responsible for.

### Risk Management

Assessing risks, developing mitigation strategies, and continuously monitoring them help minimize their impact and keep the project on track. Determining all the risks and potential issues that could arise is impossible, but naming the most likely can help guide the rest of the process.

### Communication and Collaboration

Successful projects rely on effective communication and collaboration among team members. Establishing clear communication channels and schedules ensures everyone has access to necessary information.

### Project Execution and Monitoring

Regular progress monitoring against the project plan ensures early detection of deviations and allows for timely adjustments.

### Project Evaluation and Continuous Improvement

Evaluating project outcomes and meeting objectives provides valuable insights for future improvements. Proper project closure involves finalizing documentation, conducting lessons-learned sessions, and acknowledging team contributions.

## Create Stories with Specific Outcomes

The core of agile project planning is user stories, which are concise descriptions of a feature or functionality from an end user's perspective. More generally, a story is a short description of a specific outcome. It does not contain any information on attaining that outcome- that comes later. In software, this often looks like, "As a registered user, I can log in to the website." Usually, it is helpful to include additional information like the size of the task, which project-level item it contributes to, and its priority. Traditionally, a story should be small enough to finish within a single iteration.

Using stories shifts the focus from a specific task to the value something provides. This helps prevent tasks that don't contribute enough value to the project goals. It can also prevent things like whether or not a specific task is enjoyable to impact how it gets prioritized. Feedback will often align well with one particular story, making adjustments during the project easier.

## Sprint Planning and Generating Tasks

Development teams often work in iterations or sprints. These usually go from one to four weeks, and it controls what the team will work on for that period. Figuring out how many user stories will fit into a sprint is outside the scope of this discussion, but selecting stories primarily relies on two things. The story's priority within the project (high-risk, high-value items come first) and whether or not the story needs to be done before future work can be completed.

This is also where stories are finally broken out into individual tasks. While it is essential to keep the context of the project in mind, as much as possible, tasks should be limited to what is necessary to complete that specific story. How much is included in a particular task will depend on the project and team- sometimes, a user story can be bundled into one or two tasks. In other cases, it may require several to divide the work within the team or be more specific about the work to do.

Finally, team members can pick up individual tasks throughout the sprint and work on them. Because all the work of figuring out whether or not the task is the right thing to work on is already done, it's possible to entirely focus on completing it. At the end of the sprint, there is time to review the results and make necessary adjustments to the project plan or user stories.

## Key Takeaways

- Agile project planning has three primary levels: the overall project, stories, and specific tasks.
- Things like project planning documents and SMART goals help guide the process of ensuring the project has a specific set of desired results and timelines.
- Stories break the project into more specific *results* which are small enough to prioritize and schedule. It prevents working on low-priority/low-value tasks while more important work is waiting. It is also easier to communicate and adjust stories than a single task.
- When it is time to work on a story, it gets broken out into individual tasks, which include any information necessary for completing that task.
